## Getting Started

1. To compile our project, make sure you have a recent version of Java installed (we used Java 16, but it should work for Java 8+).
2. To compile our code, please run `javac @sources.txt`. This will compile all of the Java files we have specified in our `sources.txt` file.
3. To run a "peer", run the command `java peerProcess PEER_ID`, where `PEER_ID` is a number representing the peer ID specified in the `PeerInfo.cfg` file.

> Note: our project **requires** the `Common.cfg`, `PeerInfo.cfg`, and the `PEER_ID` command argument in order to run.
